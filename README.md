# LLM Reasoning Models: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
This guide is an AI-powered look at Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with both text and audio formats available to suit different preferences.

## Purpose
I’m dyslexic and wanted a book on LRMs with both text and audio. The usual costs were too high, so I figured using AI to create it would be cheaper. Plus, I’d learn about LLMs, LRMs, and agents along the way—many birds, one stone!

## Disclaimer
I'm not claiming to be an expert here. If it reads like gibberish, you can blame the AI! I’ll do my best to fact-check and fix any errors or misleading bits.

## How It Was Made
- The first draft came from an AI agent.
- Later edits were done by another AI focusing on copy edits.
- There’ll be more drafts down the line, no doubt.

## Initial Thoughts
The first version was whipped up in a few hours, mainly to try and build a framework for AI authoring. Eventually, this might lead to a dedicated agent, which’ll be in a different repo.

## Note from the Author
I haven’t gone through the whole thing yet, so sorry if there are any stuff-ups. This is a work in progress, and I'm sharing it as it develops.

## Structure
- We’ll have PDF, EPUB, HTML, etc., so let me know if you want a specific format.
- Things like contents, front matter, and covers are coming soon.
- The audiobook uses OpenAI Nova voice.

## Suggestions Welcome
I’m all ears for any suggestions, thoughts or ideas on how to improve the book. All constructive input is welcome and appreciated.

## Disclaimers
- **Content Warning**: I haven’t checked every word, but a quick scan shows nothing harmful. Several AIs worked on this, which helps catch any nasties.
- **Accuracy**: Made with AI, so there might be hiccups.
- **Copyright**: Created with AI. Let me know if there’s any blatant copying, and I’ll sort it.
- **Future Plans**: More versions will be coming as things improve.
- **Contributing**: Not taking contributions at the moment, but might open up later.
