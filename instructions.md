Write a short book - around 10000 words - on LLM Reasoning models.

It should cover the following topics:
- What LLM Reasoning models are, how they work, and their applications.
- The differences between LLM Reasoning models and traditional LLMs.
- The training processes for LLM Reasoning models.
- The reasoning process in LLM Reasoning models.
- When to use LLM Reasoning models instead of other model types.
- Criticisms of LLM Reasoning models.
- Innovations building on reasoning or alternatives to reasoning models.

Include any further relevant topics you think are important to cover.

Break this down into chapters and work on one chapter at a time. Write each chapter to its own md file. 


Write it in book/essay form using paragraphs and sections, and avoid bullets, tables and lists unless completely necessary to illustrate a point. Use a clear but informal voice. This should be like reading a text book, but without images, references, callouts etc.

Don't skimp on details.
Do not attempt this in a single response, but rather break it down into manageable sections.
