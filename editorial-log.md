# Editorial Log & Style Guide

## House Style & Tone
- Write with clarity, precision, and a gentle deadpan worthy of a BBC voiceover.
- British spelling, please, to maintain the illusion of sophistication.
- Brevity is the soul of wit—and documentation.
- Deploy dry British wit sparingly; try not to frighten the Americans.

## Technical Rigour Checklist
- Facts first: Check technical accuracy ruthlessly—assumptions are for fools and speculators.
- Aim for clarity, not cleverness; obfuscation is for secret societies, not this codebase.
- Define specialist terms upon first use. Thereafter, assume the reader remembers (we live in hope).
- Ruthlessly hunt down and eliminate redundancy. One well-placed sentence trumps a chorus of echoes.
