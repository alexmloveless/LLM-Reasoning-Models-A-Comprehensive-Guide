# Build Process Implementation Feature Request

## Request Summary

Create a comprehensive, automated build system for the LLM Reasoning Models book project that supports multiple output formats, integrates with git workflows, and maintains deployment consistency.

## Background Context

The book project currently exists as individual markdown files requiring manual compilation for different formats. Future versions need streamlined publication workflows supporting multiple formats while maintaining editorial quality and change tracking.

## Feature Scope

### Core Build Capabilities
- **Multi-format compilation**: PDF, HTML, EPUB, MOBI output generation
- **Audiobook rebuild**: Integration with existing TTS pipeline for updated content
- **Change logging**: Automated tracking of modifications between versions
- **Documentation updates**: Sync README, docs, and supporting files
- **Repository deployment**: Automated publishing to target repositories

### Technical Requirements

#### Build Script Architecture
```bash
./build/
├── build.sh              # Main build orchestrator
├── formats/
│   ├── pdf-build.sh      # Pandoc-based PDF generation
│   ├── html-build.sh     # Static site generation
│   ├── epub-build.sh     # EPUB compilation
│   └── mobi-build.sh     # Kindle format conversion

└── config/
    ├── build-config.yml  # Format-specific settings
    └── templates/         # Output templates
```

#### Integration Points
- **Git hooks**: Pre-commit and post-commit build triggers
- **Chapter validation**: Ensure all chapters present before build
- **Dependency checking**: Verify required tools (pandoc, calibre, TTS engines)
- **Quality gates**: Validate output before deployment

### Format-Specific Features

#### PDF Generation
- Academic formatting with proper typography
- Table of contents with page numbers
- Citation formatting and bibliography
- Chapter headers and consistent styling
- Print-ready layout with margins

#### HTML/Web Format
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Search functionality across chapters
- Navigation between chapters
- Anchor links for cross-references
- Dark/light mode support

#### EPUB/MOBI eBook Formats
- Proper metadata (author, title, description)
- Chapter navigation and bookmarks
- Consistent formatting across e-readers
- Cover image integration
- DRM-free distribution

#### Audiobook Integration
- Chapter-based audio file organisation
- Consistent voice and pacing across chapters
- Metadata for audio chapters
- Export to common audiobook formats
- Integration with existing TTS workflow

### Automation Features

#### Change Detection and Logging
- **Git diff analysis**: Identify modified chapters
- **Semantic versioning**: Automatic version incrementation
- **Change summaries**: Generate human-readable changelogs
- **Build artifacts**: Track which files changed in each build

#### Quality Assurance
- **Content validation**: Check for missing chapters or broken references
- **Format testing**: Verify outputs open correctly in target applications
- **Size optimization**: Compress outputs without quality loss
- **Error reporting**: Detailed logs for build failures

#### Deployment Pipeline
- **Branch-based builds**: Different deployment targets for main/staging
- **Automated commits**: Update repository with build artifacts
- **Release tagging**: Git tags for version releases
- **Distribution**: Push to multiple platforms (GitHub releases, etc.)

### Configuration Management

#### Build Configuration (build-config.yml)
```yaml
book:
  title: "LLM Reasoning Models: A Comprehensive Guide"
  author: "Generated via AI Collaboration"
  version: "auto" # or manual version
  description: "Comprehensive technical guide to reasoning models"

formats:
  pdf:
    enabled: true
    template: "academic"
    font: "Computer Modern"
    margin: "1in"
  html:
    enabled: true
    theme: "clean"
    search: true
    responsive: true
  epub:
    enabled: true
    cover: "auto-generate"
    metadata: "auto"
  mobi:
    enabled: true
    kindlegen: true

audio:
  enabled: true
  voice: "neural-en-gb"
  speed: "normal"
  format: "mp3"
  chapters: "individual"

deployment:
  git:
    enabled: true
    branch: "releases"
    commit_message: "Release build v{version}"
  artifacts:
    keep_previous: 3
    directory: "dist/"
```

### Command Line Interface

#### Primary Commands
```bash
# Full build all formats
./build.sh all

# Build specific formats
./build.sh pdf html
./build.sh audiobook

# Build with deployment
./build.sh all --deploy

# Development builds (faster, less validation)
./build.sh dev --format=html

# Clean previous builds
./build.sh clean

# Validate only (no builds)
./build.sh validate
```

#### Integration with Existing Workflow
```bash
# Git hook integration
git commit -m "Update chapter 3"
# Automatically triggers: ./build.sh dev --chapters=03

# Release workflow
git tag v2.1.0
# Automatically triggers: ./build.sh all --deploy --version=2.1.0
```
