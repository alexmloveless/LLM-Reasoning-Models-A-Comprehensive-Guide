# AGENT.md - LLM Reasoning Models Book Project

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive book project (~10,000+ words) on LLM Reasoning Models structured as multiple chapters in separate markdown files. The book targets technically proficient readers with solid LLM/AI background.

## Project Structure
- **Chapter files**: `01_introduction_to_reasoning_models.md` through `09_practical_considerations.md`
- **Table of contents**: `00_table_of_contents.md`
- **Supporting files**: `instructions.md`, `editorial-log.md`, `chat.md`

## Key Commands & Workflows

### Git Operations
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # View recent commits
git log --stat                 # View detailed commit history
git add [file]                 # Stage specific files
git commit -m "message"        # Commit with message
```

### File Management
- Use `Read` tool for accessing chapter content
- Use `edit_file` for making targeted edits
- Use `create_file` for new chapters if needed

## Editorial Guidelines

### Style & Tone
- **British editorial standards**: Dry wit, restrained tone, avoid US-style effusiveness
- **Technical precision**: Assume reader has strong LLM background
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Define specialist terms once, avoid redundancy
- **Essay format**: Avoid bullets/tables unless strictly necessary
- **TTS optimisation**: Content will be narrated, consider flow and rhythm

### Content Standards
- **Technical accuracy**: Verify all technical claims and concepts
- **Completeness**: Add missing topics that enhance coherence
- **Non-redundancy**: Eliminate repetition across chapters
- **Logical flow**: Ensure chapters build upon each other appropriately

### Workflow Process
1. Review each chapter for accuracy, clarity, completeness
2. Make edits directly in files
3. Commit each chapter edit individually with detailed notes
4. Update table of contents if structure changes
5. Maintain editorial log of all changes

## Target Audience
Technical readers with decent understanding of LLMs who want comprehensive coverage of reasoning model concepts, training, applications, and limitations.

## Quality Assurance
- Regular git history reviews to track progress
- Critical self-review of all edits
- Structural integrity maintenance
- Consistency in terminology and style across chapters

## Chapter Focus Areas
1. **Introduction**: Evolution from traditional LLMs to reasoning models
2. **Mechanisms**: Architecture and technical workings
3. **Training**: Specialized instruction and fine-tuning processes
4. **Process**: Step-by-step reasoning methodology
5. **Applications**: Use cases and practical implementations
6. **Comparisons**: Differences from traditional approaches
7. **Limitations**: Criticisms and current challenges
8. **Future**: Innovations and emerging paradigms
9. **Practical**: Real-world implementation considerations
